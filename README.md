# Python project template
A simple template to easily start a Python project with a clean architecture.


## Installation

```sh
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Setup the pre-commit hook
pre-commit install
```

For the best experience you can also configure your IDE to directly
 show warnings and format on save.
